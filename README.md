This is the github repository for Kaggle competition IEEE Fraud Detection at https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/

# Results:
Data has been proven to be too big for my PC to handle. Some models just don't work on Python and other methods (such as downsampling) try to allocate 2.5TB of RAM when using R. The same method in Python seems to never ends.

Best result has an score of 0.7226 and was done by using an LGB Model with defaul parameters.
